2. **Time Feature Addition:**
   - A time feature will be implemented for the each racing terrain to add an additional layer of challenge and excitement.

3. **AI Integration:**
   - The AI car functionality needs to be implemented to enable interaction with the user's car, to enhancing the gaming experience.

4. **Environmental Customization:**
   - Customizations for the game environment are planned, including the addition of mountains, steep slopes, and shortcuts to diversify the racing experience further.
   - Will be fixing the UI design to look more aesthetic.
